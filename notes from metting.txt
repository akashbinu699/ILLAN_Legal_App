this file tells yes and no answers and legal procedures (it gets fed into the AI everytime we prompt it) - /Users/artemprokhorov/Desktop/Jobs : Work/Nanny AI/Ilan_Legal_App/services/knowledgeBase.ts

when we send the emails and ready to launch the app. the app should pull all the emails to the database and displayedo n front end

RAG querry should hold all the materials to each client (so RAG will use memory for each client seperately)
RAG querry should know all the drafts and case info for that specific email (email has its own case number). so rag should know all the info provided by that specific email.



1) make sure email doesnt get flagged as spam

2) change the name of cases and forms - need to ask for final format from Chris/Ilan

3) in "details" section of our web app interface: we should have email and phone number that we pulled from the database

Extra: if there's a way to pull old files from Ilan's email box to add to our database.maybe we can write a little script later to do that.
